## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You will find here a collection of projects I have been working on, including:

- some scripts I have bee using to solve practical problems in my daily life (everyday_life_utils)
- a portfolio of biomedical data analysis pipelines I have engineered over my career (biomedical_data_pipelines )
- a project I will soon start as part of my data engineering cursus

Cheers,

Nicolas
